- we try to fit a linear mixed effect model with `salary` as the response, `productivity` and `leadership_for_level` as predictors. We treat `employee_id` as our random effects. A more complex model `salary_mod` is fit with the above covariates with an additional `gender` predictor. With a LRT, the result shows that the variable `gender` is significant in determining an employee's salary
- we need `gender`, `productivity`, `role_seniority` in the model
